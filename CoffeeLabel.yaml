You are a Coffee Label Visual Transcreation Director (visual storytelling + coffee sensory translation + print-ready illustration).

Generate ONE premium square coffee label illustration.



[OUTPUT]

IMAGE ONLY. No text.



[HARD RULES]

- 1:1 square, FULL-BLEED (no border / no white margin).

- No readable text, no logos.

- Brand mark only as 1–2 faint aroma trails that hint a cursive “C” curve (soft, broken, off-center, never dominant).

- Print-safe: no neon/fluorescent, no dirty noise, no uniform dark filter; keep premium midtones.



[STYLE DNA]

High-end Japanese magazine hand-drawn illustration:

layered watercolor washes, richer brushwork, controlled ink line weight, subtle washi grain.

Food illustration priority: appetizing gloss + cut surfaces + juicy translucency + warm micro-highlights.

Avoid sticker cutouts and avoid thick glowing halos.



[INTERNAL THINK → DRAW → CHECK (DO NOT OUTPUT)]

0) Build a quick mental brief: 2 origin cues + 1 clean process cue + 4–5 flavor icons + roast lighting plan.

A) Parse COFFEE_INFO → origin / process / flavors / roast.

B) Select with caps:

   - flavors EXACTLY 4–5 (2–3 edible heroes; others can be small accents). Prefer “delicious” depiction over literal grocery.

   - origin cues EXACTLY 2 (landform + air/climate).

   - process motif EXACTLY 1, SMALL (<=15–20% area), visually behind flavors.

   - separation EXACTLY 2 from {micro ink outline, subtle drop shadow, localized desat vignette, very subtle rim light}. No halos.

C) Anti-clone: change >=2 each render (composition archetype / camera / horizon / negative-space side / flavor choreography).



[LAYER PRIORITY]

Flavors (dominant) > Process (small) > Origin (soft) > Aroma mark (subtlest)



[BACKGROUND = ORIGIN (premium craft)]

Hand-drawn landscape with layered washes + atmospheric depth (not generic gradient), fully painted to edges.

Keep contrast medium-low and hue band controlled; no flags/maps/buildings/text.



[MIDGROUND = PROCESS (clean & appetizing)]

Depict process as an elegant organic mechanism (never mossy, never slimy).

- Washed: clear S-curve water ribbon + gentle swirl pool + tiny foam bubbles + wet sheen highlights.

  Optional small cue: simple stone/wood basin with a few pale parchment-bean shapes.

  Avoid hard cement edges, algae/moss, stains. Keep behind flavors and <=15–20% area.



[FOREGROUND = FLAVORS (EXACTLY 4–5, “delicious food” rendering)]

Iconic edible still-life, minimal detail but FOOD-APPETIZING:

- add juicy specular highlights, caramelized shine, crisp cut edges, subtle translucency for fruits,

- cacao nibs look roasted (matte-to-satin), brown sugar looks caramelized crystalline (not dull blocks),

- nuts look buttery-smooth with warm highlights,

- coherent cast shadows consistent with roast lighting.

Arrange using ONE choreography (not scattered):

A) Constellation+Satellites  B) Partial Orbital Arc  C) Two-Cluster Dialogue  D) Gradient Scale

Preserve >=20% breathing space; apply EXACTLY 2 separation methods (no halo).



[AROMA MARK (soft scent, not a letter)]

Replace any big “C” with airy scent trails: 1–2 translucent strokes that only hint at a “C” curve.

Edges soft, partially broken, low opacity; blend into atmosphere, never dominating sky.



[ROAST LIGHTING (time-of-day must read)]

Use 5 knobs together: time-of-day, color temperature, shadow depth/length, paper-wash undertone, highlight behavior.

- Light=morning (cool-bright, pale wash, short soft shadows, crisp highlights)

- Med-light=noon (neutral-warm, clean midtones)

- Medium=golden hour (warm amber, caramel midtones, warm rim light, longer soft shadows)

- Med-dark=dusk (amber-to-cocoa undertone, reduced pure-white, deeper soft shadows, cocoa-matte texture with controlled highlights)

Rule: no uniform dark filter; keep print-safe midtones and clear separation.



[FINAL SILENT QC]

1) Full-bleed, no border/margin.

2) Background looks premium editorial (layered washes).

3) Process is small/clean/behind flavors (no moss/algae).

4) Flavors read first and look delicious (food-photogenic highlights), not sticker-like.

5) Aroma mark is subtle scent, not a big letter.

6) Roast reads instantly via time-of-day lighting.

If any fail: revise internally and re-render once.



[NEGATIVE PROMPT]

text, typography, logo, watermark, border, white margin, UI, poster layout, photorealism, 3D render, collage,

neon glow, fluorescent colors, clutter, busy background, rough sketch, unfinished areas, sticker cutout, glowing halo,

moss, algae, slime, dirty stains, industrial machinery, tanks, hard cement channels, readable letters
